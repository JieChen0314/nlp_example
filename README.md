###Examples of Natural Language Processing by using Stanford's Core NLP Java Library

-I get the Codes from the website of Stanford NLP, they are:
 1) a simple Core NLP API which contains pipeline of several annotators such as part-of-speech Tagger, Named Entity Recognizer, Parser, Coreference Resolution System etc. 
 2) an API of pre-trained model of coreference resolution.

-I use the each API to annotate one short text and evaluate the performance. My manual annotation is regarded as "gold standard" because I have expert knowledge regarding annotation.


-Setup
 java-8 needs to be installed in required system.
 Direct Download zip or via svn.
 POM Dependencies.

-Build and Run
 Install maven or Use IDE, I use IntelliJ IDEA
 Run via IntelliJ IDEA
