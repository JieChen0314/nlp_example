###Examples of Natural Language Processing by using Stanford's Core NLP Java Library

1. I get the Codes from the website of Stanford NLP, they are:
   1) a simple Core NLP API which contains pipeline of several annotators such as part-of-  speech Tagger, Named Entity Recognizer, Parser, Coreference Resolution System etc. 
   2) an API of pre-trained model of coreference resolution.
2. I use each API to annotate one short text that just belongs to a general domain, and then evaluate the performance. My manual annotation is used as "gold standard" because I have expert knowledge regarding annotation.
3. Setup:
 java-8 needs to be installed in required system.
 Direct Download zip or via svn.
 POM Dependencies.
4. Build and Run:
 Install maven or Use IDE, I use IntelliJ IDEA.
 Run via IntelliJ IDEA
